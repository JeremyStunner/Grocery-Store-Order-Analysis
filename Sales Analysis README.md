# Grocery-Store-Order-Analysis
This is an analysis of the Orders that were made by customers to a Grocery store. The owner of the Grocery store needed to know his best customers through 
their patronage and their locations so he can  know which of his customers would need special treatments due to their high patronage of his products.
Based on this analysis the Owner of the Grocery Store was able to retain his best customers by giving discounts to his best 20 customers by sales.
